 Look up some data

Create a few useful functions to help make sense of this data.

here's what we're looking for:

- Clean up this mess: Some things are missing. Let's remove rows that have missing fields
- Filter: Sometimes I feel like searching by name, by email address or by slogan.
  Give me the ability to filter by fields I choose
- Bulk update: Oops! Looks like some data is wrong. Let's find the bad data and
  and update it with something that's correct.

import csv

## For example
def start():
    with open('MOCK_DATA.csv') as data:
        ### Do the things here
        print "what you want here"
