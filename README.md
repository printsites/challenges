# Welcome to the PrintSites Interview Code Challenges!

These various challenges exist to gain a better understanding of a prospective candidate's logical reasoning skills, grasp of programming fundamentals, and problem-solving.

## Challenges Overview

There are 2 subsets of challenges, we'll let you know which we'd like you to work on. Specific instructions are located in comments in each file.

We want to see what you can accomplish in about 2 hours with a text editor and Google.

**Here's what we'll be evaluating you on:**

- **Do you know basic programming concepts?** Control flow, data structures, DRY, variables, etc
- **Can you Google?** Some things you may not know offhand: knowing how and where to look for answers is important.
- **How do you approach solving problems?** There are many ways to solve these problems: we want to see how you think. 
- **Are you fun?** Don't take this too seriously.

Your completed code is a starting point to have a discussion on your career (programming and non-programming background), your interests, and your career goals, all of which are more important than this programming challenge.

### Conceptual Challenges
- These are not designed to test knowledge of the specifics of a language. While the files are of a specific type (we had to pick something), please feel free to choose a language of your choice. (Ideally something used in web development - we use php, python, and javascript.)
- **We are not looking for fully-perfected, unit tests, or even fully-working code.**

#### Car Factory

See [car_factory.js](conceptual/car_factory.js)

Based on the given data, build a car object factory that dynamically produces car objects.

#### File Input

See [file_input.py](conceptual/file_input.py)

Read in some data, and give us some ways of finding certain rows.
