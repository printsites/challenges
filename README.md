# Welcome to the PrintSites interviewing code challenge!

These various challenges exist to gain a better understanding of a prospective candidate's logical reasoning skills, grasp of programming fundamentals, and problem-solving.

These are not designed to test knowledge of the specifics of a language. While the files are of a specific type (we had to pick something), please feel free to choose a language of your choice. (Ideally something used in web development - we use php, python, and javascript.)

**We are not looking for fully-perfected, unit tests, or even fully-working code.**

We want to see what you can accomplish in about 2 hours with a text editor and Google.

Here's what we'll be evaluating you on:

- Do you know basic programming concepts? Control flow, data structures, DRY, variables, etc
- Can you Google? Some things you may not know offhand, so please use Google?
- How do you approach solving problems? There are many ways to solve these problems: we want to see how you think. 
- Are you fun? Don't take this too seriously.

Your completed code is a starting point to have a discussion on your career (programming and non-programming background), your interests, and your career goals, all of which are more important than this programming challenge.

## Challenges Overview

Please complete the following projects. Specific instructions are located in comments in each file.

### Javascript Car Factory

See `create.js`

Build a javascript powered car factory, that dynamically produces javascript car objects.

### File Input

See `input.py`

Read in some data, and give us some ways of finding certain rows.
